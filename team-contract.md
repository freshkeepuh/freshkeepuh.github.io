### Team Member Availability:
https://www.when2meet.com/?31867844-Ucsvc
Fridays @ 3 PM to 5 PM virtually via Google Meet
Friday 8/29 Meeting TBD

### Contribution Criteria:
A member’s contribution is measured by their ability to complete their weekly issues on time.
During meetings, a member should discuss:
What they did this past week
What they are currently working on
What they will work on next
Any issues or blockers encountered
During meetings, team members can ask other developers if they need assistance with their feature. Team members do not need to help others if they do not have the bandwidth to help them.
At the end of the sprint, the team should reflect on the progress made and adjust next week’s goals based on last week’s data. (Adjust size of goals, timeframe, etc.)
Everyone must have at least one active issue at all times
If running into any setbacks, please notify groupmates in a reasonable amount of time so issues can be closed by the end of the sprint.

### Behavioral Criteria:
Constructive criticism/feedback:
Criticism and feedback given to other teammates should be delivered and received with respect for one another and their ideas. Feedback should be given and received constructively.
Communication:
If a member is unable to complete their issues on time, they inform the team of blockers or delays.
If a member cannot attend a team meeting, the member should notify the rest of the team at least 30 minutes in advance.
All team members are expected to respond to check messages regularly and respond within 24 hours.

### Managing Conflict:
Professional language is always required when resolving conflict.
When resolving project-related conflict:
When making significant decisions that will largely affect the project, the options should be discussed with the group (Via Discord messaging or call).
There will be a group vote with a rationale on which option the group should proceed with.
When resolving behavioral-related conflict:
Issues related between team members should be dealt with individually
If issue is not resolved the issue may be discussed within a group setting

### Failure to Honor Contract:
If a team member fails to honor the terms of the team agreement, the following steps will be taken:

First offense: A team member will privately reach out to the member who violated the contract. The member will receive a warning about breaking the terms of the contract.
Second offense: The team will hold an all-hands team meeting to discuss the member’s recent performance.
Third offense: The member will be reported to the class instructor for further action.
